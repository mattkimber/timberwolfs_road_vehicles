Timberwolf's UK Road Vehicles
=============================

A UK-inspired road vehicle set for OpenTTD featuring buses, lorries, 
trams and others from early horse-drawn wagons to the present day.

- 2x sprites for all vehicles
- 2CC selectable company colours
- Variable running costs
- NRT support including trolleybuses and non-electrified trams
- Support for FIRS, ECS and YETI cargo types
- Gameplay-optimised capacity and performance values
- Realistic horse zorbing physics

It's recommended (although not necessary) to use this set with
Timberwolf's Roads. You may also be interested in Timberwolf's
Trains for a consistent visual style and gameplay balance.

Getting Started
---------------

Road vehicles have much greater variety and are useful in a wider
range of scenarios than the default base game vehicles. The first
thing to get used to is there are no longer specific coal, oil or
mail trucks - cargo vehicles can be refit to carry any of the
game's cargo types, including those from popular industry sets.

Articulated vehicles make road transport viable for medium length,
medium production industry routes that you might previously have
only considered using trains for. The new cargo trams are an excellent
solution for connections between nearby industries, and a variety
of minibuses and smaller vehicles make services to smaller towns
viable without waiting ages for a full load.

Road vehicles have capacity bonuses for cargo well-suited to road
transportation:

* Mail
* Goods
* Valuables
* Engineering Supplies
* Farm Supplies
* Electrical Machines

Vans have additional boosts to their mail and valuables capacities,
although they have fewer refit options.

Costs can be adjusted via parameters if you prefer an easier
(or harder) game.

Running Costs
-------------

You will need to replace your vehicles even with breakdowns
set to "off"! As road vehicles reach the end of their useful life
their running costs will increase, leaving you facing a
trade-off between decreasing profits and a large bill for
new trucks and buses.

The default "spicy" setting is balanced to make keeping
a particularly good class of vehicle running for a few
extra years a viable option if the route it serves is
highly profitable.

Vehicles that were unsuccessful, unreliable or only built
as experimental prototypes tend to have shorter usable
life in game; be warned that if you use them, you will
spend a lot more on replacement or running costs than
the more proven options.

Tip: If you're playing Villages Is Villages with economic
settings enabled, increasing your operating expenses with
some older vehicles will make it easier to save up cash
for a megaproject, without losing it all to dividend
payouts.

Easter Eggs
-----------

The set includes a couple of cars I've owned that would
not typically be used for taxi or cargo services, and a further 
piece of whimsical silliness spawned by a New Year's Eve discussion 
on the IRC channel. These can be enabled or disabled by the
relevant parameter.

My thanks to all the people on the OpenTTD forums, 
IRC channel and Discord who offered suggestions, 
help and advice while I was creating the set, and
also to my YouTube subscribers and commenters for
encouraging me to post development videos.
